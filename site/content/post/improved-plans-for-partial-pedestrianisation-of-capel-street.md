description: "\"I'm really glad that the Council have agreed to trial
  pedestrianisation of Capel Street for six weekends over the summer. This is a
  huge opportunity to reimagine the street and to better envisage its full
  potential as an eclectic, vibrant northside hub, free from congestion and
  danger of traffic.\""

"The lesson from the past year is that both businesses and people benefit from more people-friendly streets - wider footpaths with places to sit, safer cycle lanes and traffic calmed roads. I really hope that this will prove a huge success for all users and businesses on the street. 

Some of the details still need to be confirmed. I'm seeking full, clear communication on the moving of disabled parking bays and a safe alternative cycle route for those coming Southbound from Bolton Street. I hope this is the first step towards much more people-friendly streets in the north inner city." 

**Report from Dublin City Council:**

Following a very engaged consultation with over 4,500 submissions, Dublin City Council will be moving forward with plans to increase pedestrian space on Capel St. 

This initiative is part of a wider programme being led by the Office of City Recovery.

Some key results of the consultation were as follows:

* 3,993 submissions received from members of the public, 85% in favour
* 121 submissions received from businesses on the street, 59% in favour
* 207 submissions received from residents on the street, 74% in favour

**The initial proposal included:**

* The area of Capel St. between Ryders Row and Parnell St. will be traffic-free on a 24/7 basis.
* Removal of all on-street parking between Ormond Quay and Mary St. and introduction of temporary buildouts. 
* Removal of a certain amount of parking spaces between Mary St. and Little Britain St. and introduction of temporary buildouts. 
* Relocation of loading bays to better align with non-hospitality businesses. 
* Relocation of disabled parking spaces to other areas in the immediate vicinity but no reduction in number. 
* Introduction of temporary buildouts between Marys Abbey and Strand St. on the West side of Capel St. 
* Introduction of temporary buildouts on Strand St. 
* Introduction of temporary buildouts between Strand St. and Ormond Quay on the West side of Capel St. 

**Changes to the proposal following the consultation are as follows:**

* Buildouts on the west side on Capel St. between Abbey St. and Ormond Quay to be increased to the size of a full lane of traffic.
* 6 car parking spaces to be retained between Mary St. and Abbey St. to assist non-hospitality businesses.
* We acknowledge the fact that many people wanted to see more ambitious plans for the Capel St area. Therefore, a series of pedestrianisation trials on an incremental basis will begin on weekends from the 25th June for a period of 6 weeks. Details of the timing, scale and level of these pedestrianisation trials to be confirmed at a later date following development of detailed people and traffic management plans.
