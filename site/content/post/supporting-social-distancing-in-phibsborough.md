  I was very happy to join with residents, businesses and other representatives
  for the local area to call on Dublin City Council and the NTA to urgently
  implement changes to support social distancing in Phibsborough and the
  surrounding areas.

The World Health Organisation have called on people to walk or cycle wherever possible during the pandemic and it is essential that we make it safe and attractive for as many people as possible to do so. 

If you have additional suggestions of where the streetscape should be altered to support social distancing for walking and cycling you can submit your ideas here: https://www.dublincity.ie/trafficservice and forward to me by email as well as I will be happy to follow up.
