title: Update on the Fruit and Veg Markets Redevelopment

description: "The Fruit and Vegetable Market is a beautiful landmark building in
  the North Inner City. It can and should be a hub for retail, culture and
  community usage and breathe vibrancy and life into the surrounding area.
  Instead it has been left derelict for far too long.  "
