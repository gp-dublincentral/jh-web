ComReg removed the Universal Service Obligation (USO) for the provision of payphones since the start of the year.  As part of negotiations leading up to that decision, eir agreed to work with councils to provide them with alternatives to the old kiosk style payphone.

One such option is an alternative payphone service to meet modern needs because as you know, the homeless use payphones to access DCC's Homeless Services.  I have attached images of the new Digital Pedestal that has a touch sensitive screen suitable for wayfinding and where the council can advertise upcoming festivals and services, all housed in a modern aesthetically pleasing unit.  Twenty two of these will be installed in Dublin City in the coming days, once the ESB strike has ended.

Another option presented to DCC, is to replace payphone kiosks with Electrical Vehicle (EV) Chargers, at no cost to the council.  DCC along with the other three Dublin councils are concluding the final draft report of a strategic study to ensure that the councils provide the best possible customer experience for the City and across the Metropolitan area in line with international experience, rapidly changing technology and available resources.  eir awaits the conclusion of this report and are poised to assist in any way they can for this worthwhile endeavour.
