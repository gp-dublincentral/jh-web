  Many residents have expressed frustration with bring centres not being open
  during the recent weeks of the COVID-19 crisis. Following representation from
  many Councillors, a plan has been put in place to provide for their reopening
  in the coming weeks. The details, as of 30th April, are below:

The civic amenity sites at Ringsend and North Strand are open and offering a full range
 of services.

 measures to ensure social distancing for staff and the public, the schedule for opening other
 bring centres is as follows:

**\- Week beginning 5 May:** Grangegorman, Kylemore Road and Marrowbone Lane
 container.

**\- Week beginning 18 May:** Windmill Road and Collins Ave.
