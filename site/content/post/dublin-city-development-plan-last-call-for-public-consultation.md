The plan’s policies and objectives are to guide growth and development, provide a strategy to achieve proper planning, and show how we will achieve sustainable development, that is development that meets our needs now and won’t comprise future generations meeting their needs.

Climate Action is mainstreamed throughout the document and the Green Party group were able to strengthen several of these commitments during the preliminary consultation phase. These commitments include:

* Retrofitting targets in line with Housing for All
* 51% emissions target in line with Climate Act by 2030
* Removal of the Eastern Bypass
* Decarbonisation zone in every LEA within the lifetime of the plan
* Retrofit and reuse of existing bildings
* Retrofit Dublin Council housing stock to a B2 BER
* All new developments (30 units+) to provide climate action statement
* Encourage the development of low carbon and highly efficient district heating and decentralised energy systems
* Decarbonising Zones: one in each LEA and all of DCC by end of plan
* Support Sustainable Energy Communities in Dublin City
* Regional Strategy for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging
* Strategic Flood Risk Assessment
* Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)



Commitments relating to transport include:

* To support public realm enhancements that contribute to place making
* Removal of the Eastern Bypass
* Accessible pedestrian network
* Last-mile deliveries
* Make permanent covid mobility interventions
* Walkability audits
* Increase children cycling to school
* Increase the modal share of walking and cycling, from 11% to 13% for walking and from 6% to 13% cycling &other micro-mobility between 2019 and 2028.
