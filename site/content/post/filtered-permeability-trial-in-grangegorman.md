The measure will use bollards to prevent motorised through traffic in order to create a pedestrian and cycle friendly zone and a safer space for local residents and for thousands of pedestrians and cyclists arriving at TUD from September 2020.

Drivers will no longer be able to use this route as a short-cut from North Circular Road to the Quays, and vice versa. Local vehicular access to Grangegorman Lower will be retained although some journeys will be required to take a more circuitous route. Vehicular access points to TUD Campus would be unaffected and access through the bollards will be maintained for emergency vehicles. No changes will be made to existing footpaths.

Turning restrictions (except for cyclists and access) will also be introduced from North Circular Road onto Grangegorman Upper and Rathdown Road, and from North Brunswick Street onto Grangegorman Lower to minimise the amount of motorised traffic entering the wider area. These restrictions, in conjunction with the proposed measures on Grangegorman Lower, are likely to create a safer and more liveable area for residents of Grangegorman Upper & Lower, Rathdown Road, Marne Villas, Fitzwilliam Place North, Stanhope Street and Kirwan Street.
