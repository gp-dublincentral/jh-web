description: "You can catch up on some of the reporting on my work on the
  Council here and the various issues I have fought for as a representative for
  the North Inner City. I have advocated for more greening, traffic calming,
  safer walking and cycling, cracking down on illegal gambling advertising,
  education and engagement on the street names of Dublin, litter and dumping, on
  proving emergency accommodation for the area and the vision for the future of
  Dublin as a climate safe city. "
