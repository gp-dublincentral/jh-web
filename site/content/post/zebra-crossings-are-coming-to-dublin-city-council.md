description: "I chaired a working group of Councillors and Council staff to
  consider whether we should proceed with a programme of zebra crossings and am
  delighted to have full support from the Council now. I believe this is a
  progressive and important step to giving pedestrians greater priority across
  the city. "

D﻿ublin City Council currently just has 3 zebra crossings across the city and have a policy against using them in favour of fully signalised crossings. However, the reality of this is that they are slow to install crossings, they are often expensive and they are not appropriate for quieter residential streets. \
I﻿ have made it a priority to change this policy across the city, got agreement to form a working group and chaired the working group through various concerns and deliberations. I am very pleased that the result of that is that we will start rolling them out, review progress and hopefully integrate zebra crossings into the normal workings of the traffic department.

The following criteria were agreed for selecting locations for Zebra Crossings: 

* Good visibility on approach;
* Volume of traffic should be sufficiently low and if possible with other traffic calming in
  the area;
* Two lanes maximum (one lane in each direction or two lanes on a one way street);
* For visibility of pedestrians no parking for 10m each side of the approach and 5m after;
* Ramped crossing where possible;
* On road of a speed of 50km/hr or less;
* Not at a location of an already signalised junction in a trafficked area;
* A speed survey should be carried out before final approval;
* A review of the site should be carried out post installation;
* Assess the need for the supplementary crossing in terms of existing and potential
  usage;
* Consider the distance to the nearest signalised crossing.

Under this new programme 5 new crossings will be installed and reviewed after 6 months, after which, on the grounds that they are working well and being well adhered to, more will be rolled out across the city.

T﻿he locations chosen for full investigation and consideration are below. After full investigation 5 will be selected for the initial batch.

* Mercer Street/Johnson's Court junction
* Johnson Place/Stephen St 
* Harrington St/Synge St Junction 
* Mountjoy Square East - Charles St Great 
* Church Avenue at Rathmines Road 53.319967
* Seafort Ave Dromard Terrace
* Ravensdale Park @ Poddle Park
* Talbot Street @ James Joyce Street
* Abbey Street Luas Stop 53.348612
* Seán MacDermott Street @ Buckingham Street 
* Ryder's Row @ Capel Street
* St. Cancies boys school, Ballygall road West
* St Ciaran’s special needs school on st. Cancies Rd
