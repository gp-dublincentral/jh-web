description: "I chaired a working group of Councillors and Council staff to
  consider whether we should proceed with a programme of zebra crossings and am
  delighted to have full support from the Council now. I believe this is a
  progressive and important step to giving pedestrians greater priority across
  the city. "

D﻿ublin City Council currently just has 3 zebra crossings across the city. The working group examined some of the concerns around zebra crossings and agreed some criteria under which they should be used. 5 new zebra crossings will be added as an initial measure.

The following criteria were agreed for selecting locations for Zebra Crossings: 

* Good visibility on approach;
* Volume of traffic should be sufficiently low and if possible with other traffic calming in
  the area;
* Two lanes maximum (one lane in each direction or two lanes on a one way street);
* For visibility of pedestrians no parking for 10m each side of the approach and 5m after;
* Ramped crossing where possible;
* On road of a speed of 50km/hr or less;
* Not at a location of an already signalised junction in a trafficked area;
* A speed survey should be carried out before final approval;
* A review of the site should be carried out post installation;
* Assess the need for the supplementary crossing in terms of existing and potential
  usage;
* Consider the distance to the nearest signalised crossing.

Under this new programme 5 new crossings will be installed and reviewed after 6 months, after which, on the grounds that they are working well and being well adhered to, more will be rolled out across the city.

T﻿he locations chosen for full investigation and consideration are below. After full investigation 5 will be selected for the initial batch.

* Mercer Street/Johnson's Court junction
* Johnson Place/Stephen St 
* Harrington St/Synge St Junction 
* Mountjoy Square East - Charles St Great 
* Church Avenue at Rathmines Road 53.319967
* Seafort Ave Dromard Terrace
* Ravensdale Park @ Poddle Park
* Talbot Street @ James Joyce Street
* Abbey Street Luas Stop 53.348612
* Seán MacDermott Street @ Buckingham Street 
* Ryder's Row @ Capel Street
* St. Cancies boys school, Ballygall road West
