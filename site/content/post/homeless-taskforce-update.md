description: The homelessness taskforce has been meeting throughout the Autumn.
  Representatives of almost every party participated in the taskforce -
  listening to the experiences and expertise of service users and service
  providers and seeking solutions to the crisis facing our city. On Friday 11th
  December the group met Minister for Housing Darragh O'Brien to present our
  proposals.

The taskforce will be meeting with the Minister again in January to further the discussion and we will also be looking to establish a long-running sub-committee so that we can monitor the implementation of our recommendations and continue to work in a cross-party manner to support people to exit homelessness and better address the root causes of it.
