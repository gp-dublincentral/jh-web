  Did you know that you don't have to be a citizen of Ireland to vote in local
  elections? You are eligible to vote if you are over 18 years of age and live
  in the local electoral area. But you need to be on the register of electors,
  or the supplement to the register. 


  Here is how you can get registered. How you vote is up to you!

## How do I get on the Register of Electors?

The register is compiled in November. After November you can apply to be added to the Supplement to the Register of Electors which will allow you to vote.

If you have a verified MyGovID account you can register or edit your details on [voter.ie](https://www.voter.ie/).

If you would prefer to register with paper forms you must complete an “[Application for inclusion in the Supplement to the Register of Electors](https://www.checktheregister.ie/PublicPages/AppForms.aspx)”. This form must be signed in the presence of a member of the Garda Síochána from the applicant’s local Garda Station. The Garda may require photographic identification (e.g. passport, driving licence etc.).

## How to I change my address if I’m already registered?

If you’re already registered (regardless of whether you are registered in Dublin Central or elsewhere) and have changed address since you registered you can [apply to change your address](https://neasahourigan.com/docs/Change%20of%20Address%20(RFA3)%20-%20English.pdf).

## How do I know if I am in Dublin Central?

[Here](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/dublin-central-electoral-district-map_356159#13/53.3638/-6.2143) is the map of the Dublin Central General election constituency. It broadly comprises the local election areas of Cabra-Glasnevin and Dublin North Inner City (with a bit of Clontarf LEA).

## How do I vote?

Irish elections are based on proportional representation with a single transferable vote. In effect you rank the candidates in order of preference. If your candidate is eliminated or has a surplus of votes above the quota your vote will move to the next candidate on your list. As such it is wise to vote all the way down the ballot as explained in more detail here.
