These new proposals follow further extensive consultation with residents, businesses and members of the public

This proposal will see the removal of traffic from Capel Street, while still facilitating deliveries from 6.a.m. to 11.a.m.

There will be no permanent works for the time-being. Interventions will be by way of temporary wands. There will be further reviews of the trial due in September
