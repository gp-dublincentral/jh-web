This is part of the Green Party's promise to deliver €1 million per day for walking and cycling projects in Ireland. This funding will support the acceleration and development of several important projects across the North Inner City, including:

* The Liffey Cycle Route
* The Clontarf to City Centre cycle route
* The Point Junction walking and cycling bridge
* The Royal Canal Greenway 
* The Blood Stoney walking and cycling bridge

As well as these large infrastructure projects, we will also see upgraded protected cycle lanes along Queen Street, Gardiner Street, Dorset Street, the North Circular Road and East Wall Road.

The funding will also support footpath upgrades across the city, more pedestrian crossings, improved access in public parks and more "school zones" to promote walking and cycling to school.
