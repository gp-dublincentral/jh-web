  On joining Dublin City Council in September 2019, I was acutely aware that the
  city is experiencing a crisis in housing and homelessness. I had the
  opportunity to join the Lord Mayor, Hazel Chu’s homelessness taskforce in
  September 2020 and, through engagement with service users and providers, got a
  deeper understanding the challenges we are facing in responding to this
  crisis. 

  I believe our services should be underpinned by human rights standards, mental and physical healthcare supports and an unequivocal commitment to ending homelessness and rough sleeping. 

  Below are some core concerns and issues I have raised with the Council and the answers I have got.

**The Local Connection Rule:**


Concern has been raised by people in homelessness and by service providers that there has been an increased trend in people being denied beds when rough sleeping, despite free beds. This seemed to be down to an unwritten “local connection” rule which says that a person must be associated with the local authority where they are seeking emergency accommodation.

Having raised a concern about this a few times directly with the DRHE, I joined with other Councillors in the Central Area Committee in [passing a motion in December 2020](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ILdE7iZwk-opTgcD3o1J1qRK610oJvPi/view?usp=sharing) calling for beds to be made available on a humanitarian basis. 

Later in December 2020 the [Minister issued clear instructions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GARZOqn3p8v22ArlB6CDjO0yNcLnBDFG/view?usp=sharing) to local authorities that no-one was to be refused a bed on the basis of lacking a local connection – with particular emphasis on the cold weather period where sleeping outside could be fatal. We were assured that where a housing needs assessment might take several days to complete with someone presenting for the first time, they should be accommodated while this is happening.

Additional instruction is needed from the Minister tightening obligations on local authorities and ensuring that the problem does not re-emerge further down the line. 


**Standards in Private Emergency Accommodation (PEAs):**

Concern has regularly been raised about the standards in emergency accommodation, and in particular in emergency accommodation facilities, from instances of violence and unsanitary conditions and the lack of support workers. This is particularly important for people suffering from complex physical and mental health needs and disabilities. 

One man, suffering from terminal lung disease kindly recounted to me his experience of living in emergency accommodation in Dublin. He told me he had been “robbed, assaulted, threatened, abused, insulted, and more besides.” “I have walked out of nine of these cesspits since January 1st 2018. It’s safer on the streets.” 

In response to a [PQ from Francis Noel Duffy, TD,](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/question/2020-09-08/409/?highlight%5B0%5D=existing) the Minister said that the exit rates from homelessness (a key indicator of the success of the services) are not delineated between PEAs and other services .

The [DRHE website](https://www.homelessdublin.ie/our-work/quality-standards) says that the National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) applied to private as well NGO run emergency accommodation facilities. I had further assurance of this through Council questions that all emergency accommodation facilities would fall under this framework. 

However, in [an Oireachtas committee hearing ](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/joint_committee_on_housing_local_government_and_heritage/2021-01-29/speech/60/)in January 2021, it transpired that this is not the case and there is not a similar standard required of PEAs who are only monitored for physical standards of hostels but not social care standards.

In November 2020, I asked for [an update on the long overdue report on the standards in emergency accommodation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zPLVjpHulfjpaLqameqGPM39cwAckoKC/view?usp=sharing). While the DRHE have assurance that that work is in progress, they didn’t give a timeline for delivery. They have since given assurance in the Oireachtas committee that the report will be made public.

**Profiting from Increasing Privatisation**

Since 2016, the amount of [money spent on privately run facilities has more than doubled](https://drive.google.com/file/d/140Iuc3Z2DVJCvC_ZI-EYqX78_SEhZAKc/view?usp=sharing). While the proportional increase of the number of people being housed by these facilities has risen by just 237 people from 1,755 in 2016 to 1,992 in 2019. 

Councillors cannot access the contracts issued to private emergency providers due to commercial sensitivity. But [an advert on Daft.ie](https://dublininquirer.com/2021/01/27/advert-for-homeless-hostel-estimates-profits-of-250-000-a-year) shows that one provider in the North Inner City was returning more than a 100% profit on running costs. 

**Contracts**

[I inquired about the process for awarding contracts to PEAs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K0Bdf1wPQxx9zTnw-EfzKTdJ_lsD_Pqv/view?usp=sharing) and was assured that the DRHE were commissioning specialist advice on the procurement of emergency accommodation but at present it does not appear that they are subject to the public procurement process which is standard in the public sector.

While the Minister assured us that we would be moving away from privatisation of emergency accommodation now that there are excess beds in the system, the answer I received to a recent question indicated more PEAs will be sought in the coming weeks.

**Financial Transparency and Oversight**

The expenditure of the DRHE has grown from [€96,254,326 to €170,334,592 between 2016 and 2019 ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/140Iuc3Z2DVJCvC_ZI-EYqX78_SEhZAKc/view?usp=sharing)and to over €200 million in 2020. This reflects the growing rate of homelessness in the city but also should require an increased level of scrutiny and oversight. However, the DRHE have not produced an annual report since 2016, despite this being the norm across the public sector. In response to several queries on this, they have given assurance that [an annual report will be produced by March 2021](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/joint_committee_on_housing_local_government_and_heritage/2021-01-29/speech/70/) of their 2020 accounts and activities. 

**Next Steps**

Preventing homelessness is the most important goal for Dublin currently. Where that fails, upholding human rights and dignity and progressing people out of homelessness should be the priority for all public investment in homelessness services. To ensure this is the case, I believe much greater transparency, scrutiny and accountability is required. Service user voices need to be heard throughout the processes and a care and health-centred approach needs to be adopted with stringent standards and inspections. I will continue to push for these. 
In the meantime, if anyone has concerns regarding specific issues relating to homelessness services in the city, please do get in touch with me or with [an appropriate service provider](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/losing_your_home/agencies_for_homeless_people.html).
