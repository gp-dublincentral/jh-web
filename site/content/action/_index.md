**Help my campaign**

We need volunteers on the ground in Dublin Central to canvas, deliver leaflets and take part in local events. You can also come along to a branch meeting (for inspiration or just a chat).  Get in [touch with me](/contact) or the [Dublin Central Branch](mailto:dublincentral@greenparty.ie) to find out more.

**Stay connected**

Stay connected on Social Media to stay up to date on campaigns and issues with which I am involved.

**Join the Green Party**

I believe passionately that Green Party principles are a pathway towards a more compassionate, equitable and environmentally responsible society. One of the ways to help is to ask your friends and family to get involved. [Join the Green Party](https://my.greenparty.ie/join)
