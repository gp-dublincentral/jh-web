You can make a difference. 

**Help my campaign**

We need volunteers on the ground in Dublin Central to canvas, deliver leaflets and take part in local events. You can also come along to a branch meeting (for inspiration or just a chat).  Get in [touch with me](/contact) or the [Dublin Central Branch](mailto:dublincentral@greenparty.ie) to find out more.

**Donate to my campaign**

Your donation allows me to connect with people and get a message of social equality and environmental responsibility out there. Please help me work towards a better future for all. [Make a Donation](https://www.gofundme.com/campaign-fund-for-dublin-central)

**Join the Green Party**

I believe passionately that Green Party principles are a pathway towards a more compassionate, equitable and environmentally responsible society. One of the ways to help is to ask your friends and family to get involved. [Join the Green Party](https://my.greenparty.ie/join)
